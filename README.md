# Space Labels for macOS (Hammerspoon)

## Why this exists
I often juggle multiple parallel projects. macOS Mission Control still calls desktops “Desktop 1, 2, 3…”, which makes context-switching harder than it should be—you can’t give workspaces meaningful names.

This repo is a lightweight, cosmetic workaround: a Hammerspoon script that lets you **label Spaces**, display the current label in the menubar and banner, switch between them quickly, and rename them on the fly.

If you find this useful, please star the repo, share it, and let’s nudge Apple to make workspace naming a **native feature**.

## Key Features

### 🖥 Core Features
- **Name your Spaces** — assign meaningful labels to desktops you choose, instead of “Desktop 1, 2, 3…”.  
- **Menubar integration** — always see your current Space name at a glance.  
- **One-click switching from menubar** — press, roll down, and release the mouse on the desired name – faster than Mission Control.
- **Visual banner** — a quick, noticeable label at the top showing the Space name whenever you switch.
- **Hotkey support** — press ⌘⌥L to quickly assign or change a Space name.  

### ⚙️ Customization & Workflow
- **Preset label system** — flexible reuse of labels from history or your own custom presets. 
- **Persistent storage** — labels are saved in an easy-to-read and editable JSON and restored after reboot. 
- **MC numbering view** — hold ⌥ while clicking the menubar label to display Spaces with Mission Control numbering.

### 🚀 Advanced Features
- **Multi-monitor support** — smart grouping across displays.
- **Multi-language support** — en / ru / de / fr / es / pt / ja / zh.
- **Auto-reload** — triggered on system wake and JSON changes.

### Usage

#### 4) Rename your Spaces
- Hotkey: **⌘⌥L** → enter a name → label assigned.  
- Or menubar → ⚙ → *Enter manually*.  
- To remove a label: menubar → ⚙ → *Delete*.  
- After some time using it, pick a name directly from menubar → ⚙ → **History** or **Presets** for quick reuse.

#### 5) Use history & presets
The system is flexible: you can reuse labels from history or define your own presets.  
They are stored in `spaces-labels.json` (created automatically on first launch, can be opened from the submenu via *Edit presets*).

**Example file:**
```json
{
  "Presets": [
    "chat",
    "proj1",
    "proj2",
    "browsing",
    "calendar",
    "finance",
    "chill"
  ],
  "History": [],


  "labelsBySpaceId": {}
}
```

**Preset ideas:**
- `chat` — messengers, Slack, Discord  
- `proj1`, `proj2` — replace with project or task names  
- `browsing` — research w/o projects link, web, news  
- `calendar` — planning, scheduling, notes, calendar apps  
- `finance` — banking, invoices, sheets  
- `chill` — music, video, downtime  

💡 *Tip: Remember, you can assign or rename a Space on the fly — as fast as your thoughts — with **⌘⌥L**. If the name proves useful, add it to your presets for permanent reuse.*  

#### 6) Customize in `spaces_labels.lua`
- Menu bar format: `MENUBAR_TITLE_FORMAT`  
- Hotkey: `HOTKEY_LABEL_EDIT` (default ⌘⌥L)  
- Banner size/position: `BANNER_TEXT_SIZE`, `BANNER_Y_POSITION`, etc.  
- Language: leave `LOCALE` to **auto** or pick from (`"en"`, `"ru"`, `"de"`, `"fr"`, `"es"`, `"pt"`, `"ja"`, `"zh"`).

If this script helps you, star the repo and spread the word:  
Naming Spaces would massively improve multi-tasking workflows. **Apple should let us name Spaces natively.** Let’s make it happen.
